# Brain-Tumor-Classification-and-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project acurrately identifies the tumor of patient and Classifies the level of tumor. 
I have used python IDLE to run this Project.
So, first install python IDLE on your personal computer.
After installing open the IDLE and run the MAIN CODE where the data gets trained and it shows the accuarcy of the tumor images.
The accuracy of the images which is known as dataset is being classified using differnt classifiers to know the accuracy.
After the data is trained the data is tested using a particular tumor image there it shows at what level the tumor is diseased.
Before running the main code run features and color segments which is used for feature extraction and segmentation of images.
